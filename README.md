# Review of Abstract Data Types
Implementation and Testing of Different Data Structures

Project 1 from Data Structures and Algorithms CSCI class. Implementing various data structures using a different ADT.
Naming convention of a data structure follows the format 'XY', where 'X' is the internal ADT and 'Y' is the ADT implemented.

*Note: Data structures tested emparically using JUnit test cases written by Dr. Thomas VanDrunen.*
